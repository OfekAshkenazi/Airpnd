# Airpnd

Airpnd is a web application that allows users to find and rent apartments, similar to Airbnb. This project was the final project in my Bootcamp.
## Introduction

The purpose of this app is to provide users with a simple and user-friendly way to find and rent apartments. We built this app to learn new technologies and expand our knowledge and skills.
## Features

- Simple authentication using session storage and HTTP requests for MongoDB Atlas data
- Filter apartments by name, location, and labels
- CRUDL operations for apartment orders, along with user messages for different actions
- Responsive and well-designed user interface


## Installation

To run this app locally on your computer, follow these steps:

```bash
Clone the project or download the files
```
```bash
Navigate to the /backend directory and run npm i && npm run dev
```
```bash
Navigate back to the main directory and then to the /frontend directory and run npm i && npm start
```

### Mobile view
We used conditional rendering and a "mobile-first" approach to make the app responsive on mobile devices. The footer menu is also interactive for routing.
